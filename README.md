Structural integrity is a critical consideration in offshore engineering, ensuring safety and reliability of marine structures. This report examines fatigue life assessment, fracture mechanics, and inspection planning for offshore wind turbine monopiles. The monopile structure, a crucial component of an offshore wind farm, is under investigation for its 20-25 years of service life. The structure, which must withstand cyclic loading from waves, faces material degradation due to marine environments. Failure could result in power production capacity loss, costly repairs, and personnel danger. The J-tube hole, a critical location on the monopile, is subject to stress concentrations that can lead to fatigue cracking. This report presents stress analysis, fatigue life calculations, and fracture mechanics-based inspection schedules, considering environmental corrosion effects, uncertainties in load assumptions, and analysis limitations.
